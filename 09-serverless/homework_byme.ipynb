The Model's Architecture is FixedEvery Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has a fixed input size defined by its architecture:Training Time: When the model was first trained (e.g., in the \"previous homework\"), the data pipeline was set up to resize all input images to a specific dimension. Let's call this $(H, W)$.Model Building: The model's layers (convolutional, pooling, dense) are built sequentially based on this input size. The number of neurons in the first fully connected (dense) layer is determined by the output shape of the preceding convolutional and pooling layers.$$\\text{Size of Dense Layer Input} = (\\text{H} / 2^L) \\times (\\text{W} / 2^L) \\times (\\text{Filters})$$\n",
